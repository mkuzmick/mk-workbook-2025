just getting ready. this isn't quite cheating.

we'll get Conrad to work a bit on projects over the next couple of weeks to involve him more in 2025. singles in both typescript (for nextjs pages) and python. for all the major apis.

let's work on telling the ten year story of the ll. but other things too? how about a list...

1. 10 years of the LL
2. stories of days
3. stories of events
4. academic work (as proof of concept)
5. cinematic interludes (or opens or bumpers) for youtube-style presentational videos.
